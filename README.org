#+TITLE: Project Work 1: A-frame
#+CREATOR: Emmanuel Bustos T.
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Description
  This is a small practice to get familiar with the [[https://aframe.io/][A-frame]] 3D/AR/VR web framework. This is part of the Real Time 3D-XR Visualization course at the Université Jean Monnet.
* Instructions
  - Make sure you have installed npm's live server by running the command =npm install -g live-server=.
  - Go to the =src/= directory.
  - Run the =live-server= command.
* Exercises:
** Exercise 1 - Simple Model
   Build a 3D model of the head of Mickey Mouse which is only composed with several a-sphere and
   basic transformations (position, scale, rotation)

** Exercise 2 - Texturing
   1. Recreate the earth with a sphere associated with the following texture “earth_4096.jpg”.
   2. Place this earth above a pink plane on which it will cast a shadow.
   3. What is happening if your use a box instead a sphere?
      R/ The texture is being loaded in each of the box's faces.
** Exercise 3 - Moon
   Add a pseudo moon as satellite of your earth (which will use the texture “moon_4096.jpg”). This pseudo moon must be associated to the coordinate system of your earth. It is hierarchically dependent to the earth (ie. when the earth turns on itself the moon follow this motion)
** Exercise 4 - Animation
   1. Now you will animate this earth by making it turn on itself.
   2. What is happing for the moon?
      R/ See point 3.
   3. Of course, your moon will also turn on itself
** Exercise 5 - Lighting
   Test the different lighting methods available in a-frame with the previous 3D visualization.
   R/ In this case, a spot light was utilized for simulating the light of the sun.
** Exercise 6 - Mickey on the moon
   Place you head of Mickey Mouse on the surface of your moon which turn around the earth and on itself.
** Exercise 7 - Robot Arm
   Build a robot arm like the one in the following image:
   
   [[./robot_arm.png]]
   
   Where each red sphere corresponds to a kneecap with 3 degrees of freedom allowing to animate this arm by simply changing the values of the corresponding angles (see below).

   Add a pair of pliers similar to the one in this picture:
   
   [[./pliers.png]]
   
   Finally, animate it.
** Exercise 8 - Welcome to the future
   You already finished everything?
   Congratulation, now you can create and animate the Boston Dynamics dog robot.
   Do not forget to add some nice textures on it!
